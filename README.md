__Boot Camp Homework 12 - Employee-Tracker__

---

__Installation:__
Deployment: in the config.db folder, find your database schema and seed files for MySQL. Query those within MySQL workbench to create your database and seed its tables.

When that is done, in your project root folder, run commands ```npm i```  and ```node app.js```.  Now you should have an active interface running in your console to manage your employees, complete with a static database to save all your data and changes.

__Usage:__
Manage your employees with enquirer and mysql.
